Hello,
Welcome to hacktoberfest2023

How to contribute
-----------------
# Step 1
I want you to create issue by yourself as I don't know what kind of content you have or in other case maybe multiple people have different links to same topics.

# Step 2
Make sure you add `hacktoberfest` label to issue otherwise the work won't be able to count in your hacktoberfest 2023.

# Step 3
Fork the repo into your account and start your work.

# Step 4
Write your content in `README.md` file. Make sure each topic has gap between them otherwise your pull request will not be merged.

Thanks, I appericiate your work.
